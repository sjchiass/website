Summary: A short documentary on the eating habits of my cats

Here is a video montage of our cats eating. They're very consistent with their habits. One always knocks on the door to be let out. Also they seem to agree how much food they leave each other.

(We feed them separately to control their portion sizes. Since one cat doesn't chew kibble, we want to encourage it to eat more wet food.)
