summary: Operating my robot over LAN with a graphical interface

## Overview

I now have a PyQt GUI to control my robot, instead of using a shell over SSH. The GUI has a bunch of controls and has a serviceable video stream.

Source code: <https://github.com/sjchiass/trilobot_controls>

## Tech

I use two technologies.

The GUI is made with [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). It's a Python interface for the Qt graphical interface library. If you're unfamiliar with it, it makes desktop applications. For example, here's a text editor made in PyQt: <https://www.binpress.com/building-text-editor-pyqt-1/>

The robot controls are made with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/). Why use FastAPI? Well, I hadn't found any easier options online, and FastAPI can accept a lot requests simulataneously. Even as I use it to send images over my LAN it still works alright.

## How it works

The FastAPI server runs on the Raspberry Pi. The PyQt GUI runs on a desktop and makes GET requests to the API. When the API gets a request, it acts accordingly.

Available controls

* 9 direction controls using the keyboard numpad
* 0-100% motor power controls
* -50%/+50% balance control for motor power, to compensate with a weaker motor
* Servo controls, 3 positions (my servo motor seems to have lost of its range of motion)
* RGB control of the TriloBot under-chasis LEDs
* BrightPi controls: visible light and infrared light, plus a nightvision mode for the camera
* A readout for the ultrasonic sensor

I've tried to implement a kind of "dead man's switch" so that the robot shuts down if it doesn't receive any requests after a few seconds. This would be good if your connection drops in front of stairs or a steep cliff. This kind of works with a background thread but it isn't perfect.

The API is able to send the images at a reasonable pace. You'd expect this to be painfully slow. Except that it's just a big sluggish. (I use the new Pi camera library, which has a bit less documentation online but does come [with examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/tree/main/examples)).

```python
@app.get("/commands/capture_camera")
async def capture_camera():
    arr = picam2.capture_array()
    im = Image.fromarray(arr)
    
    # save image to an in-memory bytes buffer
    with io.BytesIO() as buf:
        im.convert('RGB').save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=50)
        im_bytes = buf.getvalue()
        
    headers = {'Content-Disposition': 'inline; filename="feed.jpeg"'}
    return Response(im_bytes, headers=headers, media_type='image/jpeg')
```

## All of the API

FastAPI makes its own API *interactive* documentation. Great for testing the API without the GUI!
