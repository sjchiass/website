### Past week

#### Garlic fingers

I continue my quest to make authentic maritime garlic fingers. This time I added bacon bits to the mix.

  * Dough tossed in olive oil
  * 1.5 tsp of garlic butter
  * A good 1/2" of shredded cheese on top
  * Premade bacon bits to taste
  * Bake at 550F for 10 minutes, broil for 2 minutes
  * Top with dried basil

They turned out tasty but not perfect. I think I need to add a lot more garlic butter. I maybe used 1.5 teaspoons but should have gone with a tablespoon or so.

Nevertheless, it was tasty. The crust was good, and there was a lot of cheese. Thanks to the grease it wasn't dry at all, so you could eat nearly the whole thing.

#### Pizza

I also decided to try a small pizza with the leftover dough.

  * Dough tossed in olive oil
  * Cover with pasta sauce
  * 1/2" of cheese
  * A few leaves of basil
  * Generously cover with cut salami
  * Bake at 550F for 12 minutes, broil for 2 minutes

The best part was the pepperoni style salami I used. Compared to the usual pizza pepperoni, this "pepperoni-style" salami has a clear paprika taste. I had been eating it cold, but now I've seen that it's also great slightly roasted.

### Future

I think the garlic fingers need one of two things: more garlic butter or more garlic. The extra garlic could come from a garlic paste.

I'm pretty sure the maritime garlic fingers are made with margarine mixed with garlic (paste?) and basil/oregano. While I think butter is great, the margarine might get closer to the correct texture and taste. It's possible that the extra moisture in margarine has an interesting effect.
