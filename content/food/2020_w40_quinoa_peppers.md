## Pretty easy to make stuffed peppers

The air fryer was able to roast the outside of the peppers while getting the insides *very hot*.

Even better: minimal cleanup!

### Ingredients

  * Leftover quinoa
  * Large peppers
    * Here we cut the tops off
    * You can slice them in halves, making scoops/boats
  * Salsa to mix into the quinoa
  * Cheese as a topping

### Procedure

  * Prepare the peppers
  * Mix the quinoa with the salsa in a bowl (this is the stuffing)
  * Stuff the peppers
  * Top the stuffed peppers with the cheese
  * Air-fry for
    * 12 minutes at 350F for well-cooked
    * 20 minutes at 550F for nicely roasted
  * Let cool for at least 10 minutes

It's best to leave a lot of room for the air to circulate.

After 10 minutes things have gotten hot.

After 20 minutes, the peppers have started to roast on the outside. There is a clearer photo below.

You can see how the skin of the pepper has roasted.
