## Overview

The "hardy kiwi": <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinidia_arguta>

We went to pick these smaller versions of the kiwi fruit at a farm. They're smaller than the usual variety, hairless and green. They grow in clusters on vines, and they're much easier to pick than apples (high up), raspberries (thorns), and strawberries/blueberries (not sure which are ready).

When you cut into them, they look like kiwi fruits.

## Taste

They taste a lot like the bigger kiwi fruit. I think they're a bit sweeter though, and they remind me a bit of grapes.
