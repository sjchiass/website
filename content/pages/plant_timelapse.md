summary: Some automated timelapse of hydroponics plants
---

These are timelapse videos of my hydroponic plants growing. The plants use a modified [Kratky method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratky_method) with air stones that oxygenate the water periodically. So in a sense this is a mason-jar bubbler system.

The photos are taken by webcams. The leftmost plants have the camera farther away, so the photo quality is a lot better. The other plants are blurrier because the camera is closer, something I can try to fix at some point.
