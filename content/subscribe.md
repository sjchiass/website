The link below will bring you to an XML file that works as RSS (Really Simple Syndication).

### How to use RSS

RSS is a file with information on posts.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>

The file gets updated whenever new content arrives, so if you give it to an RSS reader, you will be notified when the file's contents change. The RSS reader will show you the new entry, and you can click it to open the new post.

My RSS reader of choice is <https://newsboat.org/>, a command-line reader for Linux.
